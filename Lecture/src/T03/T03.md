# MQTT

- MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol.
- It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement.
- Ideal for use in many situations
  - Machine to Machine (M2M)
  - **Internet of Things (IoT)**

---

# Publish/subscribe pattern

- The publish/subscribe pattern (also known as `pub/sub`) provides an **alternative** to traditional client-server architecture.
  - In client-server architecture, A client communicates directly with an endpoint.

---

# Publishers and subscribers

- The `pub/sub` model decouples
  - a client that sends a message (the `publisher`) from
  - a client or clients that receive the messages (the `subscribers`).
- The `publishers` and `subscribers` never contact each other directly.
  - In fact, they are not even **aware that the other exists**.

---

# Broker

- The connection between `publishers` and `subscibers` is handled by a third component (the `broker`).
- The job of the broker is to filter all incoming messages and distribute them correctly to subscribers.

# Aspects of pub/sub architecture

- **Space decoupling**: Publisher and subscriber do not need to know each other (for example, no exchange of IP address and port

- **Time decoupling**: Publisher and subscriber do not need to run at the same time.
- **Synchronization decoupling**: Operations on both components do not need to be interrupted during publishing or receiving.
