# MQTT

- MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol.
- It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement.
- Ideal for use in many situations
  - Machine to Machine (M2M)
  - **Internet of Things (IoT)**

---

# Publish/subscribe pattern

- The publish/subscribe pattern (also known as `pub/sub`) provides an **alternative** to traditional client-server architecture.
  - In client-server architecture, A client communicates directly with an endpoint.

---

# Publishers and subscribers

- The `pub/sub` model decouples
  - a client that sends a message (the `publisher`) from
  - a client or clients that receive the messages (the `subscribers`).
- The `publishers` and `subscribers` never contact each other directly.
  - In fact, they are not even **aware that the other exists**.

---

# Broker

- The connection between `publishers` and `subscibers` is handled by a third component (the `broker`).
- The job of the broker is to filter all incoming messages and distribute them correctly to subscribers.

# Aspects of pub/sub architecture

- **Space decoupling**: Publisher and subscriber do not need to know each other (for example, no exchange of IP address and port

- **Time decoupling**: Publisher and subscriber do not need to run at the same time.
- **Synchronization decoupling**: Operations on both components do not need to be interrupted during publishing or receiving.

---

# Topic

- `Topic` refers to an UTF-8 string that the broker uses to filter messages for each connected client.

- The topic consists of one or more topic levels. Each topic level is separated by a forward slash (topic level separator).

---

# Topic examples

- Each topic must contain at least 1 character.
  - Actually, `/` is a topic.
- Topic string permits empty spaces.
  - `USA/California/San Francisco/Silicon Valley` is a valid topic.
- Topics are case-sensitive.
  - `myhome/temperature` and `MyHome/Temperature` are two different topics.

# Quality of service

- The Quality of Service (`QoS`) level is the guarantee of delivery for a specific message.
- There are 3 QoS levels in MQTT:
  - `0` (at most once)
  - `1` (at least once)
  - `2` (exactly once)

---

# Setting `QoS` level

There are the two sides of message delivery:

- `publishing client` ➜ `broker`
- `broker` ➜ `subscribing client`

---

# `publishing client` ➜ `broker`

- The `publishing client` defines the `QoS` level of the message.

---

# `broker` ➜ `subscribing client`

- The `broker` transmits the message to `subscribing clients` using the `QoS` level that each `subscribing client` defines during the subscription process.
- If the `subscribing client` defines a lower `QoS` than the `publishing client`
  - the broker transmits the message with the lower quality of service.

---

Use QoS 0 when …
You have a completely or mostly stable connection between sender and receiver. A classic use case for QoS 0 is connecting a test client or a front end application to an MQTT broker over a wired connection.
You don’t mind if a few messages are lost occasionally. The loss of some messages can be acceptable if the data is not that important or when data is sent at short intervals
You don’t need message queuing. Messages are only queued for disconnected clients if they have QoS 1 or 2 and a persistent session.
